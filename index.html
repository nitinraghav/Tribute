        <p>Stephen William Hawking, born 8 January 1942 is an English theoretical physicist, cosmologist, author and Director of Research at the Centre for Theoretical Cosmology within the University of Cambridge. His scientific works include a collaboration
          with Roger Penrose on gravitational singularity theorems in the framework of general relativity, and the theoretical prediction that black holes emit radiation, often called Hawking radiation. Hawking was the first to set forth a theory of cosmology
          explained by a union of the general theory of relativity and quantum mechanics. He is an Honorary Fellow of the Royal Society of Arts, a lifetime member of the Pontifical Academy of Sciences, and a recipient of the Presidential Medal of Freedom,
          the highest civilian award in the United States. His book A Brief History of Time appeared on the British Sunday Times best-seller list for a record-breaking 237 weeks.</p>

        <p>Hawking has a rare early-onset, slow-progressing form of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), commonly known as motor neurone disease in the UK and as Lou Gehrig's Disease in the US, that has gradually paralysed him over the decades. He now communicates
          using a single cheek muscle attached to a speech-generating device.

        <h3 id="timeline"> Here's a time line of Stephen Hawking's life:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Jan 8 1942: </strong>Born in Oxford, England (300 years after the death of Galileo)</li>
          <li><strong>1953 to 1958: </strong>Attends St Albans school in North London, where he develops a passion for mathematics. His father wants him to study medicine.</li>
          <li><strong>1959 to 1962: </strong>Specialises in physics at University College Oxford. Graduates with a first class degree in natural sciences.</li>
          <li><strong>1963: </strong>Begins research in cosmology and general relativity at the University of Cambridge. He is diagnosed with an "incurable disease" at the age of 21, which is later found to be Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, a rare progressive
            disease that effects movement and speech. He continues with his research.</li>
          <li><strong>1970: </strong>Discovers a remarkable property: by using quantum theory and general relativity he is able to show that black holes can emit radiation.</li>
          <li><strong>1974: </strong>His breakthrough discovery is published in the journal Nature, in a paper entitled Black hole Explosion?</li>
          <li><strong>1982: </strong>Awarded a CBE by the Queen.</li>
          <li><strong>1988: </strong>Publishes A Brief History of Time: From the Big Bang to Black Holes, a classic introduction to today's most important scientific ideas about the cosmos. Recorded in the 1998 Guinness Book of Records as an all-time bestseller.</li>
          <li><strong>1993: </strong>Publishes Black Holes and Baby Universes, and other Essays, a collection of scientific articles exploring ways in which the universe may be governed.
          </li>
          <li><strong>November 2001: </strong>Releases Universe in a Nutshell in the UK, a book that unravels the mysteries of recent breakthroughs in physics.</li>
          <li><strong>September 2002: </strong>Publishes The Theory of Everything: The Origin and Fate of the Universe, a book that presents the most complex theories of physics past and present. </li>
          <li><strong>July 2004: </strong> Hawking announces that he has solved the Black Hole paradox, which has been a troubling scientists for years. He presents his most recent findings at the international conference on general relativity and gravitation
            in Dublin.</li>
        </ul>
